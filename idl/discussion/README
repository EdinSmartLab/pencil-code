Dear all,
This directory was created on 6 August 2007, just before
the Pencil Code User Meeting that year. The intention was
to determine which idl files are used by which users.
The outcome of this has not (yet) been discussed.

----------------------------------------------------------
Below some ideas about possible renamings
(produced during the Meeting in 2007):

files  -->  read 
write  (an extra directory)
plot

sample_specific

calc/
    /derivatives
    /module_specific/
                    /particles

obsolete/

----------------------------------------------------------
We should put this on the agenda for Summer 2018.
