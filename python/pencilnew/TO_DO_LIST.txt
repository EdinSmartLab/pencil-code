############### to-do-list for PC python package #############

* implement the following IDL routines:
  - pc_read_var_time: reads out only the time stamp of an VARX or var.dat
  - pc_read_var_raw: reads a varfile efficiently
  - pc_read_subvol_raw: reads out only part of a var.dat or VARX
  - pc_read_slice_raw: reads any 2D-slice from a varfile, wraps around 'pc_read_subvol_raw'
  - pc_read_pstalk: reads in stalk files

* use multi core capabilities to spead up processes, e.g. threads or multicore library

* * quick implementation of IDL routines by calling them using pyIDL OR IDL bridge

* manipulate Simulation files: *.in and *.local from python

* copy-constructor for simulation objects producing new simulations in a new dir
** add "resume simulation as new simulation from a certain VARXYZ or var.dat"

* vtk exporter in an efficient way (no loops)

* interactive visualization

* plot routines
** style files?

* for reading routines: read meta data of files at init, e.g. time in VAR or ts header before read()
