############### to do list for PC python package #############

Implement the following IDL routines:
* pc_read_var_time: reads out only the time stamp of an VARX or var.dat
* pc_read_var_raw: reads a varfile efficiently
* pc_read_subvol_raw: reads out only part of a var.dat or VARX
* pc_read_slice_raw: reads any 2D-slice from a varfile, wraps around 'pc_read_subvol_raw'
* pc_read_pstalk: reads in stalk files
* quick implementation of IDL routines by calling them using pyIDL OR IDL bridge


Do better reading routines:
* read meta data/header of files at init, e.g. time in VAR or ts header before read()


Use simulation objects to
* copy simulations (copy-constructor for simulation objects producing new simulations in a new dir)
* manipulate Simulation files: *.in and *.local from python
* compile simulations
* start simulation/submit
* add "resume simulation as new simulation from a certain VARXYZ or var.dat"


Put simulations in dictionary to
* sort them 
* group them


Make more efficient:
* vtk exporter with no loops
* use multi core capabilities to spead up processes, e.g. threads or multicore library


Do better visualizations:
* interactive visualization
* plot routines via typical style files
