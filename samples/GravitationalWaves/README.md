 Gravitational Waves from switching on a Beltrami field
=======================================================

## Maintainer:

## Status:

succeeds

## Recommended resolution:

16x16x16 for nu=eta=0 is fine for short times.
For longer runs, one can put nu=eta=1e-2

## Comments:

The gravitational waves are positively circularly polarized.
Therefore, hel_GWs=GWs and hel_GWh=GWh.
For EEM=1/2, the amplitudes are EEGW=2pi/4=pi/2; see (28) of Ref.[1]
and hrms=8pi/2=4pi; see (26) of Ref.[1].
The spectra denote spec_GWs = S_hdot(k,t), spec_GWh = S_h(k,t),
and both have amplitude (4pi)^2.
