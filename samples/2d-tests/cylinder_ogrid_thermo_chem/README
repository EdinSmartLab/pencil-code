Recommended resolution:
    nxgrid       x nygrid       = 240 x 480
    nxgrid_ogrid x nygrid_ogrid =  48 x 240
Comments:
 This test case test the following features:
  -solid cells based on the overset grid method (ogrid)
  -Chemistry with the simplified modules
  -lagrangian particle tracking
    - with Brownian motions
    - with thermophoretic force

Eventually, the test case should be enhanced by:
  -setting the cylinder temperature different from the inlet temperature
  -setting an initial species gradient within the domain
  -turning on homogeneous chemical reactions of the gas phase
  -turning on heterogeneous chemical reactions of the solid object
  -turning on heterogeneous chemical reactions of the particles(?)
