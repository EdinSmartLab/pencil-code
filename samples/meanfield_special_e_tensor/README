Comments:
    This sample shows how to use special module meanfield_e_tensor.
    Different run.in files describe different models.

    The module uses parallel HDF5 to load up datasets, so it should be compiled with
    CFLAGS=-I<path to HDF5 installation>/include
    LDFLAGS=-lhdf5_fortran -lhdf5hl_fortran -L<path to HDF5 installation>/lib
